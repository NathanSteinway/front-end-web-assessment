            <h1>SKILLS</h1>
            <p>I have spent over 15 years competing in Esports. My accolades include Grandmaster rank in Starcraft 2, Diamond in League of Legends, top 10 in DFW for Super Smash Brothers Melee, and top 3 in TX for UNICLR. Playing games this way allows me to learn more about myself and serves as a catalyst that compels me to strive for something better.</p>
            <p>I have 5 years of experience practicing traditional kung fu at <a href="https://www.leeswhiteleopardkungfu.com/">Lee's White Leopard Kung Fu</a>.</p>
            <p>Throughout all of my life I've loved music and can play the drums as well as the guitar. I was a drumset player for Jazz Band and the drummer for a metalcore band in highschool.</p>
            <p>I have the ability to develop a full-stack website from scratch.</p>
